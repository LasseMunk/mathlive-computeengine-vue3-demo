in the index.html

run `npm install` in the root of the project to install packages

run `npm start` to start the local vite server and try it out.

I have added the vue-router if you want to jam around creating more pages, and routes - see `src/router`, add views to the `views` folder and make a link in the `nav` in App.vue
